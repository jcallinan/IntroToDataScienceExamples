# Introduction to Data Science â€” Code Examples

This repository contains classroom-ready Jupyter Notebooks that accompany the textbook:
**"Introduction to Data Science: A Python Approach to Concepts, Techniques and Applications"** by Laura Igual and Santi SeguÃ­.

Each notebook corresponds to one chapter in the book and includes:

- Clear code examples
- Descriptive markdown cells for learning
- Visualizations (with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`)
- Statistical analysis examples (`scipy.stats`)
- Setup guidance for new students
